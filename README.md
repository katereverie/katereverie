Hi, I’m Jiantao. Want to get a quick vibe check at me? Read the following.

- My takes on Software Development
  1. Tools iterate quickly; fundamentals barely. Focus on fundamentals. 
  2. Programmers are not developers; developers are not engineers/architects. They distinguish by their ability to abstract order from chaos.
  3. Shoot yourself in the foot early so that you don't blow your entire leg off later.
  4. Communication bridges different fields as software bridges machines and humans. Without communication there is no software.
  5. One person cannot wear all hats; but know who wears which hat!
  6. 12 hours of work without proper rest does not increase productivity.
 
- Fun facts about me
  1. I was born on a snowy day where it hadn't snowed for 60 years.
  2. I once had a squirrel and a lizard as pets.

- Cold facts about me
  1. I speak English, German, and Japanese fluently as a Chinese native.
  2. I've lived in Japan for 6 years and in Germany for 7 years.
