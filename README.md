- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jiantao.
- ðŸ‘€ I have previously built SAP projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the React Framework.
- ðŸ‘€ These mini projects aimed at honing my frontend-related basic skills.
- ðŸ‘€ Currently, I'm focusing on full-stack software development using C# to hone my backend-related skills. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also trying to integrate my Capstone projects with .NET Frontend Frameworks so that I can properly demonstrate solid, fundamental fullstack development skills in C# as well.

- Besides programming, I enjoy learning languages, reading, and casual gaming.
- When I am not lounging, I also enjoy dancing and jogging.
