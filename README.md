- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jiantao.
- ðŸ‘€ I have previously built SAP projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the React Framework.
- ðŸ‘€ These mini projects aimed at honing my frontend-related basic skills.
- ðŸ‘€ Currently, I'm focusing on full-stack software development using C# to hone my backend-related skills. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently moving towards learning ASP.NET to integrate my Capstone projects with a .NET Frontend Framework so that I can properly demonstrate solid, fundamental fullstack development skills.

- Besides programming, I'm an avid language learner and teacher, casual gamer, and a pragmatic philosopher.
- When I am not lounging, I also enjoy dancing and jogging.
