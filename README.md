Hi, I’m Jiantao. Want to get a quick vibe check from me? Read the following.

- My takes on Software Development
  - Tools iterate quickly; fundamentals barely. Focus on fundamentals, adapt reasonably.
  - Seniorities of tech roles are distinguish by the ability to abstract order from chaos, not only at code organization but also at software design.
  - Shoot yourself in the foot early so that you don't blow your entire leg off later.
  - Communication bridges different fields as software bridges machines and humans. Without communication there is no software.
  - One person cannot wear all hats; but know who wears which hat!
  - Proper rest increases productivity.
 
- Fun facts about me
  - I was born on a snowy day where it hadn't snowed for 60 years.
  - I once had a squirrel and a lizard as pets.

- Cold facts about me
  - I speak English, German, and Japanese fluently as a Chinese native.
  - I've lived in Japan for 6 years and in Germany for 7 years.
